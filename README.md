### Hello!

I'm Erik Hermansen. I've been creating software professionally since 1992. Some past work of my own includes:
* The [Deadly Rooms of Death](https://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games.html) (DROD) series of video games, released from 1997 to 2014.
* [The Godkiller - Chapter 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449570/The_Godkiller__Chapter_1/), released in 2021.
* [A bunch of Medium articles](https://medium.com/@ErikH2000) on software engineering, work life, creativity, ethics, and running.
* A million multimedia projects featuring animation, motion graphics, voice, and music.

My current focus is on local-LLM web apps. Myself and others are creating open source tools, mentoring opportunities, and a portal for them at https://decentapps.net.

I am happiest when I create, and I enjoy the company of people that share this spirit.
